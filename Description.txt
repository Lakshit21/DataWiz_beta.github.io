>> agreegated_duty_cycle

"<p>The chart will analyze the Duty Cycle.</p>
<p>We can find the total rotation time by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total rotation = RPM x total rotation time</li>
  <li>Total rotation time = total rotation / RPM</li>
</ul>
<p>We are given on-time and off-time (assuming it is the total time).</p>
<p>Total active time = on-time - off-time</p>
<p>Based on some conditions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Startup or shutdown time</li>
  <li>Acceleration and deceleration time</li>
  <li>Time to maintain equilibrium of the motor (assuming these devices have motors)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total active time should be greater than or equal to total rotation time.</p>
<p>In total rotation time, the motor is working efficiently. This phenomenon can be used to measure the efficiency of the motor as well as the device.</p>
<p>Duty Cycle = (total rotation time / total active time) * 100</p>
<p>Duty Cycle is the percentage of active motor time. It indicates the productivity of the motor and the effectiveness of its duty.</p>
<p>A higher Duty Cycle percentage means the motor is more efficient, while a lower Duty Cycle percentage means low motor utilization.</p>
<p>The chart is a scatter line chart that displays valid data items, excluding zero RPM and items with > 100% Duty Cycle.</p>
